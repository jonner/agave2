Agave2 is a re-write of the Agave Colorscheme Designer

This is a tool for web and graphic designers to generate color ideas.  It is
designed to integrate well with the GNOME desktop environment.

Agave2 is still in a fairly early state, so if you need a useful tool, you're
advised to use the original version of Agave for the time being.  The original
version of Agave can likely be installed from your linux distribution's software
repository, or it can be downloaded in source form from
http://home.gna.org/colorscheme/
